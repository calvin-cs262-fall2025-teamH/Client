a. Demographics:

i.   I am a junior!
ii.  I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science (BCS) and English (BA) with a Linguistics Concentration!
iii. In CS 112, I got a B, and I am currently in CS 212. 
iv.  I am in section CS 262-B. I can attend the entire lab session!

b. Technical:

i.  I might train to work with DB2 this semester at my internship, but I have not formally worked
    with those yet. 

ii. I have used all of the above. I used Slack for some student communication but during my internship
    for team communication as well. In a student project in Abstraction, we briefly used Trello, so 
    I have some exposure. For Git/GitHub, I have briefly explored both out of my own interest, but we
    also used GitHub in CS 112 for project submissions. 

iii. Here is my project proposal:

     My idea for an application that is both interesting and tractable would be an app that would use
     a database of over-the-counter medications and their ingredients to compare a product to another
     to see if there are cheaper options for customers. This would be useful for people who have a need
     to buy medications regularly or are on a budget and were not aware of cheaper (and equivalent)
     options.

     But I am also interested in anything to do with ML and AI! I also like Micah's ideas
     about the Financial Tracker and Lecture Note Taking!

c. Personality:

i.   My big-five personality type is:
     79% Aggreableness.
     77% Openness. 
     65% Extraversion.
     62.5% Conscientiousness.
     46% Neuroticism.

ii.  I think I probably should not work with Pauline since we are housemates and we want to avoid any
     potential conflicts or disagreements!

d. No, I don't think so!
