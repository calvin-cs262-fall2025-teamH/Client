# Lab 7 Answers:

## a. An alternative to using ReactNative's "context" to store the app state could be using a state management library like Redux (https://www.dhiwise.com/post/comparing-performance-react-redux-vs-context). Redux provides a more structured approach for complex state logic applications, where actions must be dispatched from many places.

## b. The app actually loads the item data when the user of the app goes to the Items screen. The React hook that is used in this case is the useEffect hook. It is used to fetch data from the API when the component "mounts", meaning when the user navigates to that screen and the component is rendered for the first time.

## c. Copilot worked pretty effectively for me on this assignment. It was able to help me combine the appropriate components from each of the previous labs in order to create this final app. I did have to do some manual coding to get it to work the way I wanted it, like adjusting some formatting (such as titles in the app) and fixing other minor bugs. Overall, though, it was very useful and actually allowed me to understand each component better while creating it efficiently.
