# Fetch App

**Promises:** The code uses Promises through the `fetch()` function, which allows it to be managed asynchronously while the program is still running.

**JSON:** The code uses JSON to parse the data from the included URL in the fetch operation, and it uses `JSON.parse()` to convert string data into JavaScript objects.

**Hooks:** The code uses hooks including `useState` to manage loading state and product data without needing to write class components.

**HTTP methods:** The code uses HTTP methods through the `fetch()` function to retrieve product data from the URL.

## If I were to modify the URL value to an invalid URL value (like https://invalid/), the app would show a white screen with no data values from the URL displayed on it.
